1520276495495,"Disappointing movie, really. It could have been so much better except for the anti-white/anti-cop/anti-Christian agenda that infects the first half of the script. Once the London writer gets his predictable angry liberal rant out through his characters and actually attempts to depict rural America in an uncondescending manner (if that's possible for Hollywood). The second half starts to recover by softening Frances character and fleshing out Sam Rockwell's. Unfortunately, Frances' bitter, man hating character is way too one dimensional (the real woman Marianne Asher-Chapman, was much more nuanced, the Director should have depicted that) and frankly tiresome. 

Rockwell, however, despite his hammy role written for him by an anti gun Londoner urbanite, puts in a sterling performance. I haven't watched the driberal self congratulatory bash at the Dolby theater but I'm assuming this movie did very well, the racket-machine had earmarked it for an ""Oscar nod"" months before and I think most, like myself, had decided they liked Frances character just going by the trailer cuts.

This allegory is a testament to the dying patriarch in our country, highlighted by the dying sheriff coughing up blood on our female protagonist. One of the few nice guys that cowed to the alpha female lead is beaten and thrown through a second floor window. The racist evil male deputy is burnt alive by the female lead and only redeems himself when he gives himself over to her cause. The backdrop to this tale is the dead daughter sacrificed to the male evildoers, this alone allows the female lead to burn a police station, drill though her dentists thumb and cause mayhem through this tale unabated, her ex is portrayed as a typical asshole ex' in these chick flicks even though his daughter was killed under his ex wife's watch, half way through the film his ex wife seems to lose another daughter after making her walk miles into town, she is never seen or heard from again in the film.",0,FALSE,0

1517922142480,"This movie could've been great but there are just too many things in it that don't make sense-
(Spoiler Alert):

1) Despite the billboards being out of commission for decades and the company who owns them not even knowing of their existence, they still charge Mildred $5000 for a month and she doesn't even try to haggle! What is she, a kid?
2) Woody Harrelson is dying from cancer yet looks completely healthy throughout.
3) Woody has a foreign and much younger wife; the background to which isn't explained at all.
4) Woody's Police interview technique. As with all movie cliches, there is no tape-recording of the interviewing or any video, there isn't another person present, and he's standing up leaning over her, menacingly, as he's speaking to her. In a modern country in 2017 like the US this would not be allowed to happen.
5) After Jason throws the guy from the window, causing him major injuries, it is witnessed by a Police chief and Jason isn't arrested, at any point!! He's just fired, like you would a Burger King employee who's late too many times.
6) The potential rapist who threatens Mildred in the shop- why?! There is no motive at all for him to come in and do that.
7) Mildred's amazing ability, despite her being a gift-shop worker, to fire-bomb a Police station with the skill, precision and expertise of an experienced Commando, like she's done it thousands of times.
8) Mildred gets away with attacking the dentist, despite him having an unusual injury that he would be very unlikely to sustain by himself. The interview is stopped because Woody is ill- so why wasn't it continued by another officer at the time?
9) Jason is allowed back into the Police station at night, by himself, after being fired. 'You've got your keys, just let yourself in,' he's told. Really?! After being fired? You'd surely go to his house and collect those keys, or at least change the locks.
10) Mildred experiences no consequences after attacking teenagers, with lots of witnesses around.
11) The billboards are on fire and Mildred, driving past, just happens to have with her a 50-liter fire extinguisher- very handy. And after the fire's put out, only the paper has been burnt, but the wooden structure is absolutely fine. Hmmm.
12) Why didn't the cops, who we're told have no problem with doing serious stuff like torturing people, simply rip down or deface the billboards in the beginning? They are far away from anywhere, with no residents, CCTV etc.
13) No proper investigation into the arson attack on the Cop Shop.
14) Jason turns from a psycho into a saint, despite undergoing significant trauma.",0,FALSE,0

She lacks to depth and range of Meryl Streep in my opinion but she is pretty damn good at these ""Fargo"" roles. I think the movie tried a bit too hard at making some of the characters overly quirky to give the movie an edgy feel. Woody Harrison has never been a good actor and he wasn't that great in this one either, very typical over the top acting. The one scene I questioned was when McDormand and her son are driving at night and they come across the billboards burning and right away they ran out with fire extinguishers. Did I miss something?

SHE IS A PSYCHOPATH.  HILLARY CLINTON.  SHE TRIED TO TURN EVERYONE INTO ONE IN THE 1980s WITH ALL THE RANDOM SYNTH BULLSHIT METAL PERIOD BUT SHE FAILED BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE STILL REGULAR.  AND NOT PSYCHOPATH.  SHE MISFIRED AND HAD TO SLOWLY TURN EVERYONE INTO A PSYCHOPATH USING CULTURE AND TECHNOLOGY WHICH SHE FIGURED OUT IN THE EARLY 2000s WITH THE IPOD.

YOU ARE ALL FUCKING DUMB AS SHIT.  YOU ARE ALL JUST CONTOLLED BY HILLARY CLINTON.  EVERYONE IS A PSYCHOPATH NOW.  SHE FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THIS WITH THE IPOD.

SHE USED DAVE GROHL.  BRANT BJORK.  CORMAC MCCARTHY.  TO DO THIS.

IT HAS BEEN A DICTATORSHIP IN SILENCE FOR YEARS SINCE WORLD WAR I.  RICHARD NIXON STARTING IN HIS 30s.  THEN HILLARY CLINTON STARTING IN HER 30s.  

THEY HAD TO DO THIS TO COVER UP THE WAR.  HE WAS REGULAR.  SHE IS A PSYCHOPATH.

SHE HATED EVERYONE BECAUSE THEY WERE DIFFERENT THAN HER.  THIS IS WHY THEY ALL CROWD SURFED IN THE 90s.  AND NOW THEY JUST STAND AROUND WITH CELLPHONES.  BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL LIKE HER.

The ex husband's girlfriend - ""Oh! I kinda need to use the bathroom!? Oh is this inconvenient? I can see it's inconvenient"" Holy shit that's some bad moviemaking.

McDormand can't even order the damn billboard without the scene being hammed up right from the start. But at least she gets to say some swear words! Ho ho! Rockwell's character didn't work either, just comes off as an actor trying too hard. In fact, it's writer/director McDonagh who's trying too hard. And it shows.

Another situation that the film doesn't answer and

 spoilers 

I can see why it is irritating to end a film right before an important moment and would have provided a more satisfying conclusion if they showed an ending where the men in the bar that were probably responsible for the death of the main character's daughter were killed off by the two anti-heroes. But in defense of the ambiguous ending, I thought it was satisfying to end it that way.
