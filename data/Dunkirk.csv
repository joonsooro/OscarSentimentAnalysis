The heavy atmosphere of everything , the time passing extremely slow , to the point of it being unsupportable . The sound of bombs and screams of suffering. This movie tricked me thinking i was there too in a way that ive never experienced.   Not only it succeeded to make me feel there , it also made me realize that we are lucky right now. I got a monstrous respect for the people who lived in those dark time. Its not human , we werent made to experience this. Its beyond the limit. Its pure hell.   Look at us now , its like we forgot what humanity went through , we hate and insult each other for meaningless things like a tweet on the internet. We cry and blubber constantly while not seeing what we have right now and how lucky we are. We forgot what happened so we slowly are repeating the story until its too late. We are weak , so weak.  Its one , if not THE best movie i have ever seen. Movies are made to make us feel.

En las playas de Dunkerque, cientos de miles de soldados de las tropas britÌÄåÁnicas y francesas se encuentran rodeados por el avance del ejÌÄå©rcito alemÌÄåÁn, que ha invadido Francia. Atrapados en la playa, con el mar cortÌÄåÁndoles el paso, las tropas se enfrentan a una situaciÌÄå_n angustiosa que empeora a medida que el enemigo se acerca. Cuando pensamos en Memento o El truco final , no quedan dudas de que el director puede hacer la pelÌÄå_cula que quiera incluso hacer resurgir el mito de Batman con El caballero oscuro. Sin embargo a Nolan le faltaba una pelÌÄå_cula histÌÄå_rica, un drama sobre la segunda guerra mundial y que mejor propuesta que Dunkirk. Decir que es una mala pelÌÄå_cula serÌÄå_a injusto, tiene muchos mÌÄå©ritos, incluso grandes posibilidades de ganar el Oscar a mejor pelÌÄå_cula, sin embargo no era lo que esperaba TÌÄå©cnicamente es una pelÌÄå_cula impecable, la fotografÌÄå_a, el montaje y la producciÌÄå_n en sentido general son de excelente factura. Dunkirk es una historia sobre sobrevivir en condiciones adversas, sobre el patriotismo , contada de manera simple sencilla. Si la puesta en escena es potente es realmente el compositor Hans Zimmer quiÌÄå©n se lleva realmente todos los elogios, incluso por encima del director Dunkirk no alcanzarÌÄå_a ni la mÌÄåÁs mÌÄå_nima intensidad si no fuera por la exquisita banda sonora y el diseÌÄå±o de sonido de uno de los mejores compositores de la industria Demasiado larga para mi gusto, cansona , que no me emocionÌÄå_ y que en todo momento me hizo extraÌÄå±ar al viejo Nolan Fionn Whitehead, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Harry Styles y Tom Hardy, quiÌÄå©n nuevamente se tapa la boca se atienen a desempeÌÄå±ar sus personajes Sin excesos Le perdono Dunkirk a Nolan y espero que me deslumbre en sus prÌÄå_ximos proyectos como lo hiciera con Interstellar o Inception",0,FALSE,0

The French were not the only ones defending the perimeter - there were several British regiments (eg Norfolks, Seaforth Highlanders, Gordons) who all went into captivity (if they weren't dead or bayoneted en route to Germany). The French ""government"" didn't want their men evacuated at first. When the British took the French off the beaches (leaving 100,000 approx of their own men behind) to the safety of England to form a Free French Army under de Gaulle, the French Government demanded they be returned, together with their rifles. So, the allies lost 100,000 Brits and returned 110,00 French thanks to the bloody French Government. The French should look at the behaviour of their Government at that time and the standard of their Generals, and stop blaming us for everything. We gave the Free French a home and armaments, we supplied the French Resistance, de Gaulle was permitted to broadcast to France via the BBC, we sold our soul to America, and we crawled back up on to their beaches. The Allies advance in 1944 was delayed waiting for the French so de Gaulle could march into Paris (quite an electioneering move) and thus liberate his capital.

In the whole 60 months the British Empire, with 419 million people, fought in WWII, it only lost 383,000 troops. In the 45 months America, with less than a third as many people--131 million people, fought in WWII, it lost 403,000, meaning the monthly rate of American loses was 40% higher that its British Empire ally with more than three times the people.   If Dunkirk is any example, it probably was a good thing the so avoided fighting.",0,TRUE,3

As the enemy forces close in it seems the troops have nowhere to go, but help is at hand and a fierce battle ensues. - Written by Dik Nolan May/June 1940. 400,000 British soldiers are holed up in the French port town of Dunkirk. The only way out is via sea, and the Germans have air superiority, bombing the British soldiers and ships without much opposition. The situation looks dire and, in desperation, Britain sends civilian boats to try to evacuate the beleaguered forces. This is that story, seen through the eyes of a soldier amongst those trapped forces, two RAF fighter pilots and a group of civilians on their boat, part of the evacuation fleet. - Written by grantss Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II. - Written by Robert Paege",0,FALSE,0

Starting with the positives, this film is shot on beautiful film, has great props and wardrobe, it utilizes practical effects, has excellent sound effects, and has a musical score that drives the film. On the negative side of things the musical score drives the film forward constantly building you up, but once the build up stops you don't receive that satisfying of a conclusion. Very often the heavy accents and dialogue is difficult to understand, there's too many characters and none of them show any character development and lack character depth. Compared to Saving Private Ryan and or Pearl Harbor this film is really underwhelming in terms of action sequences. The best scenes visually are the flight sequences, bomb droppings, and even those are underwhelming. I also feel that if this film was rated R instead of PG-13 it could have added more realism. I feel like if this film would have shown the French soldiers who were also evacuated from Dunkirk and the French who sacrificed themselves to defend the city against a superior enemy in weaponry and numbers it could have fed my need for more action and the need to escape Dunkirk thus making the conclusion more satisfying.

1.50202E+12,"For all the people who weren't satisfied, here is Dunkirk in a nutshell - what it means as a film:  May contain spoilers  Click read more.       Dunkirk is only about British people! Ì¢‰âÂå¢Dunkirk focuses on BRITAIN. It was made by British filmmakers so they will inevitably have a bias towards their own nation.  What's the point of Dunkirk? It's confusing! Ì¢‰âÂå¢The film's focus is largely upon the ""Little Ships of Dunkirk"". The 700 civilian boats which sailed to Dunkirk from Ramsgate, England. Mark Rylance's character is meant to exhibit the selflessness of these individuals in their quest to save lives. This was the part of Dunkirk which is particularly special to British people. In Britain, people mention the ""Dunkirk Spirit"" as phrase which represents selflessness and a sense of duty. Nolan wanted people to understand this ""Spirit"", that's why at the end of the film, 3 of the main characters (The soldier from the beach, the Spitfire pilot and Mark Rylance) all end up in one of the little ships.  Why is it split into 3 stories? It's confusing! Ì¢‰âÂå¢The film is split into 3 aspects (Planes, Beach and Ships) because Nolan wanted to display the role each of them had and their experiences and thoughts clearly. The soldiers on the beach are desperate to escape. The ships are desperate to save the soldiers. The planes are desperate to save the ships. At the end of the film, the 3 stories merge into one. That completes the story of Dunkirk.   Why are there no German soldiers? Ì¢‰âÂå¢The Germans are never shown because Nolan wanted to create an overwhelming sense of fear. In other films like Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge, you can see your enemy and you know where they are. In Dunkirk, you never know where they will be. The opening scene where the soldiers run down the street and get shot shows this perfectly. They were just strolling down the street when out of nowhere the Germans opened fire. This is continued into the beach when people look to the sky in fear because of the Luftwaffe bombing them. That's why the Stuka bombers are so terrifying with that dive-bombing siren, because they come out of nowhere.   There are no French people! It's unfair!  Ì¢‰âÂå¢The French were given a small amount of screen time but nonetheless some. The film focuses on Britain so they were always going to be in the background. The opening scene exhibits the French Army's fortifications at Dunkirk and how they held the Germans back as long as they could. The French soldiers on the beach trying to evacuate on a British ship were denied entry because the British ships serve Britain. France had their own evacuation ships and additionally, they would be evacuating from their own country. At least British soldiers were evacuating back to their homeland, not away from it. Regardless, many tens of thousands of evacuees were indeed French as on the characters portrayed, many French managed to get themselves onboard British ships, either by disguise or other methods. At the end of the film, Commander Bolton (Navy guy on the pier) repays the French because he refuses to evacuate with the Army Colonel and says he is staying behind for the French.   There is no dialogue! Ì¢‰âÂå¢The film lacks much dialogue because it's focus is on actions. The film is very much about actions speak louder than words, hence the British civilian boats rescuing all the soldiers from the beach. They didn't whine or complain, they DID it. They, as Mark Rylance said ""have a job to do"". The soldiers don't speak much because it's meant to be more of representation of soldiers in general. The experience of the main soldier on the beach (The Mole), along with Harry Styles, is meant to represent the struggle of all 400,000 soldiers. It's not dedicated to an individual or their personality. It's not Hacksaw Ridge where the film is based on one specific guy and his life. It's based on the experience of 400,000 stranded soldiers.   There is not enough explosions or action! Ì¢‰âÂå¢The film is sedate in its lack of explosions and action because it's meant to be realistic. Nolan himself is not one for explosions as most of his films use practical effects. Dunkirk is a film made to show duty and selflessness in the evacuation. It's not meant to have flashes and explosion. The plane scenes are made to be as realistic as possible. Tom Hardy only fires his Spitfire's cannons in short bursts. That ensures maximum accuracy. It's meant to be realistic, it's not Star Wars. He's not Han Solo and he's certainly not going to fly around and blast everyone into a fireball!  Why is it so confusing? I don't get the film? Ì¢‰âÂå¢For people who don't UNDERSTAND the events of Dunkirk, it's no surprise that this film is confusing. It's not about knowing what happened. It's about understanding what's happening. That gets explained in the film but many people still don't understand it. The theme is the evacuation. 400,000 people stranded on a small beach, surrounded by the German army. They cannot stand their ground, their only option is to evacuate. They are only a few miles from their home, England, yet The Channel separates them. They were never going to make it home, that's why Churchill said he wanted 30,000-40,000 to make it back. That's roughly 350,000 DEAD. They didn't account for the civilian aid which they received. THAT'S what makes Dunkirk unique. Without them, they would have all DIED. The pleasure yachts, the fishermen, the crabbers, the weekend sailors and the all the rest of the 700 ships were the savours. That's how they got over 350,000 back alive. That's why it's such an incredibly important historical event. The fact that a group of people who could easily have sat at home decided to sail into gunfire, Luftwaffe planes, Kriegsmarine U-Boats and more is amazing. That's why Commander Bolton starts crying when he sees them. When the men couldn't get HOME. HOME CAME FOR THEM.  This whole theme and rescue ties in with something called the ""British Spirit"" (it probably doesn't exist any more - it probably died out somewhere towards the 1990s, possibly even the 1970s). The British never give up spirit. The ""We shall never surrender"", ""We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be"". That's how Britain Ì¡ü‰ÛÁåÂÌ¡ü‰ÛÁå¤ survived and won the War. Britain NEVER gave up, they went the extra mile. That's why the soldier on the train at the end reads out Churchill's never surrender speech. That's the theme - never give up, never surrender, we're all in it together.   This is why it's a confusing film for many non British people because they may not be familiar with the idea of the ""British spirit"" and so they don't understand the importance of the film and its message.",677,TRUE,77

1.50202E+12,"For anyone going to watch this movie and are expecting brilliance, that wasn't the experience i had. I came away from this movie feeling... Meh. I don't understand the hype over this movie. I gave it a 7/10 at best, probably more like a 6 but i'm feeling generous. It looked stunning and the sound was great, Tom Hardy was top notch, there were some quite intense (but samey) moments, costumes and they way people looked we're good, and it started brilliantly, one of the best starts I've seen in a movie...   However there were a few problems i had with the movie. It was too cheesy and the acting suffered because of it. The historical inaccuracies made the movie pretty piss poor. If i'm watching a war movie, i want a good depiction of what it was like... mainly with the planes, they had endless amount of ammo, they couldn't have landed on sand, and there wasn't enough of them.  I feel like moving back and forth through time was unnecessary... There was no need for it, it didn't help with suspense, it was just there for the sake of it.  I couldn't care less about the characters.  There was a lack of violence/blood/limbs flying off lol, which i understand it isn't necessary, but this movie really needed it in my opinion.  Lastly it didn't give a great attention to threats. Yes there are planes dropping bombs, a few 'oh shit he is going to drown', but what about from the opposing side? Not one German was seen, and you didn't get a sense of struggle to hold the beach.  These are all i could come up with off the top of my head without being too boring.  ----- This is my opinion and everyone is entitled to their own.... you're wrong if you thought it was amazing though ;)",0,TRUE,1

1.50202E+12,"Just got back from the movie, it's actually quite terrible. Easily Nolan's worst movie to date.  I'm not going to spoil the plot, although anyone familiar with history of the region already kind of knows. Aside from how this movie doesn't really have a plot that goes much beyond that anyway. (Yes be prepared for extremely minimalist dialogue for the most part, alongside non-linearity that destroys a sense of plot.)  The music in this is goddamn awful, the 'suspense shots' take forever to finally show what happens with a VERY annoying musical tone that simply does not end and the editing with flash backs to what is supposed to be happening simultaneously really completely destroys the movie's credibility. It feels incredibly fake. And it has a pretentious underlining to it that simply does not suit it. It might have worked had these scenes not taken forever.  It's not a good movie. It's actually pretty darn bad. It has a strong opening, but shortly after that it complete falls flat. Take it from me, the trailer is way better than the movie hinting at a lot more action. You will not really get a lot of action in this and what's there isn't quite very good or that interesting. Some scenes are interesting from a visual point of view, like some of the dogfighting and some of the wide shots on the beach.  But the actual dogfighting itself looks incredibly bad with the viewer wondering why the hell the pilot could not hit on the first try having a perfect line up with the target. Anyone who's ever flown or played a flight simulator would at least taken a shot. Not in this movie. No, in this movie they wanted to have the pilots line up at least three times, only to kind of hit the engines perfectly. Sorry, but that's not how dogfighting in reality goes. You will generally have a hard time lining up for a perfect shot. Whenever you come even remotely close, you will fire for sure. I don't care if they think bullet preservation was a thing (which it was), but this is not how you shoot down planes. Aside from that the number of German airplanes make no sense.  At this point in the war, the German airforce was actually pretty much superior in numbers. Not in a 3:1 kind of way, but rather a 10:1 kind of way. We don't see that at all. Instead we see random dogfights, which apparently are supposed to be close to the beach and boats, but really aren't taken there.   For a beach that had over 400.000 soldiers (in this movie only between maybe a 1000 to 5000 at best are ever shown) you would expect many more bodies. It would also make the 'duck on the beach' scene more plausible, because people would not be able to run anywhere with 400.000 people at the same spot. With maybe 500-1000 people though it looks painfully bad in how there would be room to run out of the firing cone of the attack fighters diving in from high up. It's bad. Why did they not use post-processing to add 100 times the amount of people here? They definitely should have.  And I can't believe how much modern day buildings, objects or items are still visible in this movie, including modern containers on the beach near the end. Holy fcking moly?! I think Christopher Nolan must not be very aware of what the older France looked like, because this stuff is really noticeable.  As far as the plot itself goes, they are on the beach and they get of the French beach aaand that's when the movie ends. I'm sure this was an important moment in history (hence Churchill's speech and some propaganda surrounding it at the time), but sadly it just does not work very well for a movie. I'm not even sure the movie does the whole thing justice in how scale of things was completely destroyed by a lack of people on the beach, lack of boats in numbers and so on.  I don't want to compare to Saving Private Ryan (as that's clearly less historical in many ways or rather more of a Hollywood approach to history if you will), but if you're expecting something with a story and the occasional action more along those lines, you're going to be GREATLY disappointed. Be prepared for a fairly boring movie, characters with which you kind of do not connect, all with their own series of events that are edited together in a rather poor way. I would not recommend this movie even for rental, it's that poor.  Oh, last but not least, the acting itself in this movie is alright. It's not spectacular but that's mostly due to how it's a bit light on dialogue anyway. My disliking of this movie has very little to do with the acting in this. There are some cringe worthy moments though, so don't expect the acting to save the movie. 4 out of 10, maybe 5 out of 10, definitely not more than that. Don't believe the 8,9 score nonsense.

1.50202E+12,"So I've watched it today. And I have to say... it was extraordinary. This wasn't a movie, this was a feeling. The atmosphere, the music, the tension... it really stucked in my mind. I can't even explain it. The actors did a great job, some of them haven't even spoken much, it was all about their face expression. Oh and can I defend Harry a bit? I knew he's doing some film but I had no idea he'll be here, when I decided to watch the movie. And I expected him there for maybe 10 minutes without saying anything important. I'm a fan of him, but that's not the case. He was good! I really think he could be a great actor. So yeah, I get it, his name can get some more audience for the movie but he did a good job too.  For example, Cara Delevingne is a beautiful modell, but I just can't see her as an actress. She's kinda unnatural in her movies. But of course, it's just my opinion, I can be wrong. Just wanted to say it because I've met some negative comments and so... But anyway, if you like historical war movies, watch it! I highly recommend it. P.S. I really liked the other protagonist-blackhaired-boy. Never seen him before, but it's something special about him. P.P.S. Tom Hardy is amazing as always, duh. P.P.S.

Not of the average British/French soldier. It doesn't show you what happened in the city, but more specific what happened in that time on the beach. That's what the movie is about.

1.50202E+12,"Not a fan of this movie. Too lazy in an historical point of view. Actually i found the reality far much better in an epic way. Dunkirk it is not only the beach but also the city under the bombs (almost destroyed), the civilians trapped and scared, the ones who fought at the border knowing probably they were gonna die, the germans who were too close, the ones on the beach waiting and getting on the nerves, the ones who are coming to save them and afraid to be too late, the ones who decided the operation dynamo.  At that moment, during few days, dunkirk is really the end of a world, it is the end of Europe as we used to know, it is doomsday. But there was also hope, it brought faith to the future. The present was done, we had to fight for future, so we had to save many as we can. And the ones at the border were fighting for that. And the ones on the boats were coming for that. Dunkirk is a miracle because of all those actions, because so many did what they had to do, soldiers, civilians, just humans but good ones.  I was certain Nolan could do with all of these, but no. He choose the artistical point of view ( and he did well) above history. And doing so, i think he choose facility as we already know his genius as a director. (telling such a story as dunkirk it must be really difficult but also really exciting for an artist, so i am disapointed).  And for all these reasons, Nolan should have call his movie "" dynamo"" (for the operation) not dunkirk. (And be kind for my english, please, as it is not my native language).",0,FALSE,0

So let me get this straight: The main character is the only one of six people to escape German machine gun fire in the streets of Dunkirk, then almost sneaks onto a boat (which then sinks), then tricks leadership into letting him onto another boat (which is torpedoed and then sinks), then sneakily grabs onto another boat to get taken to shore, then sneaks into the hull of another empty boat on the beach that - despite being full of bullet holes - is magically able to make it out to sea, but ultimately sinks next to another boat that is also sinking, only to be fortuitous enough to get picked up by a small passenger boat in the area that also managed to pick up a crashed RAF pilot and the only survivor of a torpedoed destroyer. Whoa, that is a lot of boats and one hell of a day! Saving Private Ryan did a great job of telling a fictional story that is believable; this tells a ""true"" story that is completely unbelievable.

1.50202E+12,"I definitely see Dunkirk winning best Motion Picture, Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, and best Cinematography at the Oscars HANDS DOWN! This is one of the most historic, important, and life changing events in human history.This story and event brings tears to my eyes because it truley is remarkable  Dunkirk is a technical and visual masterpiece! Christopher Nolan delivers get again a stunning, beautiful, and groundbreaking spectacle that captivates and entuces you into this heartpounding world. This is one of the most gorgeous films ever made HANDS DOWN! And this will most certainly be used in future filmaking classes as a staple and classic in filmaking. The way the film is handled first of all is so raw and realistic! The film is shakey and mean, which provides the audience with a captivating and incredibly believable and lively perspective on the film, making them feel like they are in the horrific situation with the characters. The camera work is exceptionally vivid, clear, and wide making it easy to spot and distinct everything that is out on screen, such as the characters, action, shios, boats, planes, etc. There was not one moment in the film where I found it difficult to pinpoint details, even in the raw and chaotic sequences. There are a lot of beautiful, gorgeous, mind blowing, and powerful wide shots that are used in this, primarily because 70 + percent of the film was shot in Imax cameras. The wide range shots are some of the best I have ever seen..PERIOD! From the beaches, the cities, the ships, boats, sea, everything is shown so grand and beautiful, which really compliments and presents the incredible cinematography and spectacle this movie truley is. This movie is also 100 percent realistic. Real people, real planes, real boats, real ships, and real sea and ocean. In fact this movie was actually FILMED IN DUNKIRK! It all looks so amazing, and movies should take note of Christopher Nolans work here. However, to me where the camera work really shines and revolutionizes filmakimg today are the close quarter shots. Oh my God I have never been so allured, captured, invested, blown away, and grateful for camera work such as this! These close quarter shots grab, pull, and lure you into these scenes! My lord it was ju s incredible and I have never experienced anything like it before! Every time they paned into a character (s), boats, planes, ships, underwater, explosions etc, it was soooooo whiteknuckling and intense! It was done so old school but fresh and modern at the same time! I have no words to describe how brutal and intense it was when it was close quarters I really don't! You feel like you are struggling for survival with them and you yourself feel like you are in parell. Scenes and shots like these make you feel fear, anxiety, pain frustration, nervousness and hoplessness, and that just about sums up Dunkirk. When men are jumping into the water and swimming for their lives, bombs are dropping in every corner, ships are sinking, planes are up in the air fighting for their lives, people that are inside of a ship have no way out and are struggling to escape.....you feel like you are there with them every step of the way. This tells you how much of a technical triumph Dunkirk is, and it is all practical. This proves why practical effects, if done right, will always give you the best experience you will ever get, and this is one of it not the best technical film ever made.   CONGRADULATIONS TO THE CAST OF DUNKIRK! WHAT AN AMAZING CAST! This is beautiful just beautiful! Thank you to every single one of these people involved in this incredible and beautiful project! Every single one of these incredibly talented people bonded together to give us sonething unlike anything we have ever seen before, and Iam not forgetting about the two amazing actors that are Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy who did an incredible job on this film! Ladies and Gentleman the incredible and heartpounding Dunkirk is one of the best experiences you will ever have! Words like thrilling, heartpounding, intense, emotional, suspensful and much more!  This film is chaotic, white knuckling, exciting, incredible, mezmerizing, and beautiful are in my vocabulary! This is one of the best war films ever made, one of the best movies in years! Hell this might even be my favorite war film ever, or the best! I have to think about that for a while, but there is no doubt this is one of the best war films ever, and the best cinematic experience you have ever had, or ever will have. This a once in a lifetime experience, and it is something unlike anything you have ever seen before! Dunkirk is not just a film, but an event every movie lover, or person in general, needs to watch! Dunkirk is one of the best films in a long time. It is a triumph in every way possible! I LOVED DUNKIRK BEYOND BELIEF! This is my favorite film of the year and one of my favorite films of all time! It gave me the best movie and cinematic experience I ever had, and I will never forget watching this incredible film in Imax! Dunkirk is absolutely incredible, mesmerizing, beautiful, gorgeous, thrilling, dramatic, chaotic, powerful, unique, tense, grand, emotional and breathtaking! I hate it when you look foward to a film so much, you watch it, you love it and than it is gone. You can always watch it again, and I will certainly do so, but that first time is classic original, and treasurable. This is my most memorable movie experience ever. DUNKIRK WILL ALWAYS HOLD A PLACE IN MY HEART! THIS FILM BROUGHT ME INTO TEARS! I will never forget Dunkirk and the once in a lifetime experience I had watching this film. This is a masterpiece in my book. Christopher Nolan you did it again you Legend. One of the greatest filmakers in history, and the best filmakers around. And everyone do youselves a favor and WATCH THIS FIL. IN IMAX! IT IS WORTH IT TRUST ME! This movie is made for Imax, and you quickly realize this when you watch the movie. Iam telling you, if you want the best experience you have ever had, and want to watch Dunkirk, watch it in Imax, and be prepared to be bloooown out of the water! You will never forget it. I certainlly will not. Thank you all for giving us this beautiful art. This is the biggest movie event of the year everyone!

Good acting, not one actor overshadowed the other in terms of screen time, Mark Rylance seemed to have the biggest role. I could have waited until the movie came to the $2 theater. A lot of the action seemed hard to follow; first it would be daytime, then night, then back to daytime w/the boats & airplanes, was unable to tell if it was the next day or day before, seemed kind of disjointed.

Most notoriously was the case of the Wormhoudy massacre where nearly 100 British troops of the Warwickshire regiment were shot and grenaded by SS troops in a cow shed after they had fought to the last round.

Ships waited there to carry home the British Expeditionary Force, which had been fighting alongside the French in its defensive war against the German invaders. Agreeing to surrender, the trapped regiment started to file out of the farmhouse, waving a white flag tied to a bayonet. They were met by German machine-gun fire.  They tried again and the British regiment was ordered by an English-speaking German officer to an open field where they were searched and divested of everything from gas masks to cigarettes. They were then marched into a pit where machine guns had been placed in fixed positions. The German order came: Ì¢‰âÂÒFire!Ì¢‰âÂå Those Brits who survived the machine-gun fire were either stabbed to death with bayonets or shot dead with pistols.  Of the 99 members of the regiment, only two survived, both privates: Albert Pooley and William OÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢Callaghan. They lay among the dead until dark, then, in the middle of a rainstorm, they crawled to a farmhouse, where their wounds were tended. With nowhere else to go, they surrendered again to the Germans, who made them POWs. PooleyÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢s leg was so badly wounded he was repatriated to England in April 1943 in exchange for some wounded German soldiers. Upon his return to Britain, his story was not believed. Only when OÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢Callaghan returned home and verified the story was a formal investigation made. Finally, after the war, a British military tribunal in Hamburg found the German officer who gave the Ì¢‰âÂÒFireÌ¢‰âÂå order, Captain Fritz Knochlein, guilty of a war crime. He was hanged.",1,FALSE,0

1.49934E+12,"My grandfather joined up in 1939 having already been shot and in the trenches of WW1 in his youth. He arrived home in Stockport from Dunkirk with pneumonia and was never properly well again. Need I remind everyone born into the world since 1945 that you probably would not have been born unless your parents were German and Aryan. Our parents would nave been part of slave races who would have been starved to death one the new German world was built. Dunkirk was a God given miracle that saved the world not just the British troops. Hitler was shown on propaganda newsreels after Dunkirk smiling and looking at England through binoculars. Luckily for all the peoples of the world he set his eyes instead on Russia. This gave time for us to build up the RAF for the Battle of Britain.  The Winning of the Battle of Britain was the second miracle. Many houses of the people on fire were burnt as fire engines raced past to save factories. The Fire Brigades of Derby were detested by the people at times but it was say more important to build the engines for aircraft to fight for the the country.  We are now faced with other races who want the world to work their way, with their inane laws and archaic attitudes to women. They want us to have their religion, to be mindless beings with no brain cells of our own. No freedom of speech - wasn't that Adolf's idea. Remember Manchester a few weeks ago.  Go to watch this film. Watch the earlier Dunkirk movie. Tell your friends. Dunkirk was the miracle that saved the freedoms of the peoples of the world not just the British. Tonight I will say a liitle prayer for the forgotten French servicemen killed in the sinking of the French ships still in French ports after Dunkirk. Sunk by the British to be kept out of German hands. Never let anyone tell you that the Holocaust did not happen. I was born after 1947 but I saw the tattooed numbers on arms and also the scars on stomachs of several Jewish girls from sterilisations done without anaesthetic so they could work for the german army - not saying here how. Read up on how the slaves brought to the channel Islands were treated.

They're supposed to have an impact on the audience. Nolan's first two movies, Memento and Insomnia, were rated R, and they were great. But it seems like Nolan thinks that since all his other movies were PG-13, that means PG-13 is the only way to go. Well all his previous movies just happen to work as PG-13, because they have no content that should be higher level, but this definitely will. And is Nolan really dumb enough to think an R rating will limit the audience? When I saw Deadpool, most people in the theater looked 12 years old. The fact that it was directed by Nolan means the theaters will be full of teens, regardless of the rating. Teens also seem to love war movies in general. But still, Nolan decided to severely reduce creativity in an attempt to make a little more money. This is going to be a bunch of watered down crap. When people die, they'll just look like they're passing out drunk. I thought Nolan was above this kind of bullshit. And it's a real shame, because Nolan is a great director, I'm sure he could've made a great war movie if he wasn't such a pussy. Fucking pathetic.

Hitler sanctioned the order on 24 May with the support of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW). The army was to halt for three days, which gave the Allies sufficient time to organise the Dunkirk evacuation and build a defensive line.

Or maybe the reanimated corpse Stanley Kubrick? I didn't think so. I only learned of 1 Direction and this member named Harry from the buzz surrounding Nolan's newest project, and like most people who have interest in these historical films, or are fans of Nolan's work, probably don't think so highly of these new ""pop"" bands, which in my opinion are shitting all over the fundamentals of music, yet as stated above, Nolan wouldn't blindly pluck a man from mainstream success in hopes of generating more buzz around a project, since he already had people buzzing around his next ORIGINAL film (not Batman), since we walked out of theater thinking if the top fell or kept spinning right before the credits rolled in Inception.

1.4888E+12,"The idea of the Germans somehow destroying the Allied forces at Dunkirk is rather overplayed as a what-if.  Keep in mind that the ground around Dunkirk was pretty bad for armour, and the British had a large amount of anti-tank guns in play, plus Royal Navy warships offshore and RAF air cover. Putting in such an attack regardless would probably destroy many of the best German formations as viable units, putting the Fall of France very much in doubt. The Germans were also low on logistics such as fuel and ammo, but they were also low on spare parts, and of their vehicles were on the verge of becoming mechanical casualties. Early war tanks were not fantastically reliable compared to today's. On top of that, they didn't have much in the way of things like artillery support, because they'd outrun that as well. The British, in contrast, had fallen back onto their supply lines, so they were well supplied with everything, on top of potential support from the Royal Navy and RAF from the other side of the channel if things got dire enough.  Hell, to put it in a little more details, Dunkirk itself was terrible tank country to begin with, being surrounded by boggy grounds, marshes and protected along much of the outside of town by a large canal. The British had so many troops trapped there that they could afford to be strong everywhere; there was nowhere to outflank them, the only way in was a direct frontal assault. Dug in around the perimeter were several hundred QF 3.7"" AA guns, the British answer to the German FlaK 88. Those weren't suitable for AT use in the field, like the 88s, because they were heavier and the carriages weren't really well designed for it, but in a situation where they wouldn't have to be moved, they were just as deadly. Any German armoured attack would have ended up literally bogged down, in the open, right in the sights of all of those guns, and then they would have reached the canal and been unable to cross. It was, really, an incredibly strong defensive position, and the British were evacuating troops from there even before von Rundstedt halted.  The only way to swing it is for the British to surrender on account of the 'hopeless' situation, which isn't exactly inconceivable (they did it at Singapore, for example, despite being in a much stronger position relative to the Japanese invasion force). The BEF actually being destroyed militarily by the German forces facing it at that point is unlikely in the extreme as said before once they get support from the Royal Navy and RAF if things get dicey for the British.",5,FALSE,0

Hitler sanctioned the order out of fear that there was going to be turn around for the Allied Forces if things continued the way they were based on advice given to him by his top Field Marshals, the halt would only last three days. This allowed the Germans to consolidate their men and strengthen their offensive line, but also allowed the Allied Forces to finish preparations for evacuation and build a defensive line. This was not near enough time for all the Allied Forces to evacuate, but it did make a massive change in what would've likely happened otherwise. 330,000 men escaped, but over 50,000 never made it out as well as losing a massive amount of vehicles, weapons and other military supplies to the Germans.",17,TRUE,3

1.4888E+12,"Key facts about the true story   Dunkirk evacuation code-named Operation Dynamo, which took its name from the dynamo room that provided electricity in the naval headquarters below Dover Castle, where Vice Admiral Bertram Ramsay planned the operation.  Real 1st watershed of the war leading to german final defeat : with BEF crushing, UK had no chance to stop invasion and would probably had to ask Armistice, even with ChurchillÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢s incredible willingness to fight.   3 main causes of this Ì¢‰âÂÒmiracle of DunkerqueÌ¢‰âÂå that saved UK (and so finally Ì¢‰âÂÒshaped our worldÌ¢‰âÂå as the trailer says) :  - Haltbefehl : astonishing german decision to halt their Panzers Divisions on 24 May, at the moment they were about to crush Allies in Dunkerque quite easily. To explain this first huge german mistake, majority of historians now agree to say it came from RundstedtÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢s /HitlerÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢s fear to loose precious Panzers for the last phase of the battle, Fall Rot Ì¢‰âÂ‰ÛÏ crushing of remaining French forces in the south, combined to GoeringÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢s boastfulness who claimed his Luftwaffe was sufficient to stop the evacuation. Alternative theory based on so-called HitlerÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢s indulgence for England seems to be post-rationalization for his fatal mistake.  - HeroÌÄåøsm of RAF & AlliesÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢ fleet, mainly British, who managed to evacuate 338 000 soldiers on 400 000, vs 45 000 only expected to be saved at the beginning. Role of Dutch coasters, which saved 23 000 men, must be mentioned.   - Often forgotten sacrifice (probably not evoked in the movie) of 30 000 french soldiers of 7th Army, who defended DunkerqueÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢s perimeter and so managed to cover evacuation, despite hopeless outnumber - around 1 vs 10 ratio.    ////Anyway good news to see for once a big movie produced by a big American studio, about WWII warfare not involving US (War didnÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢t start with Pearl Harbor!)",0,FALSE,0

And I've really come to appreciate the significant improvements digital capture has made in the last decade - thank you very much, people at Red and Arri. Great job! But seeing this, I can understand why Nolan still has a thing for film. Last years The Force Awakens (shot on 35mm film) was absolute reference quality. This one looks the shiznitts, too. And the quality of 15perf70 'true' IMAX was never under debate anyway. I wonder how the 65mm film shot segments in Dunkirk will look compared to the 65mm digitally Arri Alexa captured Rogue One.

They got dragged through first world war then put into mass poverty after, then they had massive economic boom prior to being dragged into another war (England and Poland almost forced it on Hitler) so a lot of change in a short time. During that war they had to deal with huge amounts of nazi propaganda only to realize too late what was going on with the jews etc, although the amount of jews killed was way over fabricated so the west could use it as their own propaganda.   In the mean time the German civilians were under attack from every front, civilian women were repeatedly raped while the family had to watch if not shot, hung or burned already. That was not just the Russian front doing that, the Americans also hated all Germans due to western propaganda and they turned blind eye to certain regiments under their influence to do similar war crimes to the normal German civilians, while no doubt American and British took part in some of it too.   That is all after good old church hill pioneered ''terror bombing'' aka dropping bombs on civilians, then the next night when the German civilians are trying to dig their relatives from the rubble Churchill sends the planes back in to drop fire bombs on the rescuers. But western lies will have you think the Germans were the ones who started bombing civilians, not to mention Churchill had an Indian concentration camp that killed way more Indians before Hitler so much as snarled at a jew. Lasty, after all is done even today normal Germans are still branded with the same nazi brush while none of the terrors they suffered are shown any light.  I think western film makers have no balls to make a good German film because they know how much propaganda and hate we have been fed about Hitler, the Nazis and the Germans. The Nazis in the beginning were actually very good, for example. At that particular time they were a way better example of how to care for your nation than today's governments of almost every country. If a film maker would so much as say Hitlers name in anything but a negative light the mass of under educated tools would brand them a racist Nazi fk.",0,FALSE,0

1.4888E+12,"The reality of Dunkirk in May 1940:  On 22 May, Churchill's Cabinet decided to retire the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) from France. Anthony Eden formally ordered the commander of the BEF, General Lord Gort, to deceive his Allies about the British Army's intention to retreat. Churchill contributed to the deception by reassuring French Premier Reynaud that Britain was firmly committed to victory. Even as the British prepared to evacuate, they tried to convince the Belgians to continue to fight. The Belgians did remain on the field of battle for an additional five days, which delayed the advance of German Army Group B toward Dunkirk. As the author points out, ""Far from being betrayed by their Allies, the British military commanders in France and Belgium practiced on them a methodical deception which enabled the British to get away with their rear defended.""  Lord Gort was instructed not to inform his French and Belgian colleagues that the evacuation was beginning. South-east of Dunkirk the British withdrew their units, leaving seven French divisions alone to face the advancing Germans. The French fought on until their ammunition was exhausted and managed, like the Belgians, to tie down German forces that would otherwise have been available to assault the perimeter of Dunkirk.  http://www.historiography-project.com/jhrchives/v02/v02p375_Lutton.php",0,TRUE,1

At its heart, Gottfried Leibniz, the German philosopher-mathematician, and Isaac Newton, the English physicist-mathematician, set out two opposing theories of what space is. Rather than being an entity that independently exists over and above other matter, Leibniz held that space is no more than the collection of spatial relations between objects in the world: ""space is that which results from places taken together"".[5] Unoccupied regions are those that could have objects in them, and thus spatial relations with other places. For Leibniz, then, space was an idealised abstraction from the relations between individual entities or their possible locations and therefore could not be continuous but must be discrete.[6] Space could be thought of in a similar way to the relations between family members. Although people in the family are related to one another, the relations do not exist independently of the people.[7] Leibniz argued that space could not exist independently of objects in the world because that implies a difference between two universes exactly alike except for the location of the material world in each universe. But since there would be no observational way of telling these universes apart then, according to the identity of indiscernibles, there would be no real difference between them. According to the principle of sufficient reason, any theory of space that implied that there could be these two possible universes must therefore be wrong.[8]   Isaac Newton Newton took space to be more than relations between material objects and based his position on observation and experimentation. For a relationist there can be no real difference between inertial motion, in which the object travels with constant velocity, and non-inertial motion, in which the velocity changes with time, since all spatial measurements are relative to other objects and their motions. But Newton argued that since non-inertial motion generates forces, it must be absolute.[9] He used the example of water in a spinning bucket to demonstrate his argument. Water in a bucket is hung from a rope and set to spin, starts with a flat surface. After a while, as the bucket continues to spin, the surface of the water becomes concave. If the bucket's spinning is stopped then the surface of the water remains concave as it continues to spin. The concave surface is therefore apparently not the result of relative motion between the bucket and the water.[10] Instead, Newton argued, it must be a result of non-inertial motion relative to space itself. For several centuries the bucket argument was considered decisive in showing that space must exist independently of matter.  Kant  Immanuel Kant In the eighteenth century the German philosopher Immanuel Kant developed a theory of knowledge in which knowledge about space can be both a priori and synthetic.[11] According to Kant, knowledge about space is synthetic, in that statements about space are not simply true by virtue of the meaning of the words in the statement. In his work, Kant rejected the view that space must be either a substance or relation. Instead he came to the conclusion that space and time are not discovered by humans to be objective features of the world, but imposed by us as part of a framework for organizing experience.[12]  Non-Euclidean geometry Main article: Non-Euclidean geometry  Spherical geometry is similar to elliptical geometry. On a sphere (the surface of a ball) there are no parallel lines. Euclid's Elements contained five postulates that form the basis for Euclidean geometry. One of these, the parallel postulate, has been the subject of debate among mathematicians for many centuries. It states that on any plane on which there is a straight line L1 and a point P not on L1, there is exactly one straight line L2 on the plane that passes through the point P and is parallel to the straight line L1. Until the 19th century, few doubted the truth of the postulate; instead debate centered over whether it was necessary as an axiom, or whether it was a theory that could be derived from the other axioms.[13] Around 1830 though, the Hungarian JÌÄåÁnos Bolyai and the Russian Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky separately published treatises on a type of geometry that does not include the parallel postulate, called hyperbolic geometry. In this geometry, an infinite number of parallel lines pass through the point P. Consequently, the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180Ìâå¡ and the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is greater than pi. In the 1850s, Bernhard Riemann developed an equivalent theory of elliptical geometry, in which no parallel lines pass through P. In this geometry, triangles have more than 180Ìâå¡ and circles have a ratio of circumference-to-diameter that is less than pi.",0,FALSE,0

War would be over in September 1939 r when French and British would launch their offensive on the west against few Wehrmacht divisions. I have nothing against common soldiers but I would drown this French and English pigs: politicians and generals.

Please click [read more] to help many people.       The Syrian refugee crisis. This is a terrible thing that is happening because groups in Syria are fighting. Then multiple terrorist groups enter the area to take advantage of the war. Groups like ISIS don't care who they kill. They kill people who disagree with their extreme views. Because of this, people like you and I are fleeing from their country to other countries that will let refugees in. Sometimes they need to travel across the water in tiny boats with hundreds of other people on them. On these boats, people fall off and drown. Others starve or get sick. Personally, I think we aren't doing enough to help these people. By ""us"", I mean the U.S., other countries and everyday people like you and me. To raise awareness send, comment, text, email or share these hashtags: #WeCanHelpSyrianRefugees | #SRC | #StableSyria | #SyrianRefugeeCrisis Keep in mind, kids can help spread awareness too.

I'm sorry to the Harry girls out there even though I'm also one, this movie wouldn't be known because of the impact of the plot behind the story, but fangirls seeing Harry Styles acting. They're all worried about Harry Styles getting killed and all, well also a lot of people died here. Not only Harry, if ever. You kinda like over shadow other actors acting by focusing on to one thing and that's unfair. I'm a WW2 junkie, and I've known this to be made before Harry Styles was casted because of Benedict Cumberbatch's series potrayal of Dunkirk many years ago.   If you're gonna go into the cinema, refrain yourself from squealing and being over joyed about seeing Harry because this is not about Harry. This is about our history and we should respect it as other audience are not there to focus on one thing but the plot and everything else. Please, I beg you, let's be mature about this. Honestly I'm a big fan. I love Harry Styles since boot camp, but making Harry seem more important than other characters is just... Not right.   PLEASE DIRECTIONERS, LET'S BE MATURE ABOUT THIS, I know you're all excited but this isn't all about Harry,'kay? I'm not hating or anything, I'm just saying so people wouldn't be discourage in watching this. Because some of them are actually interested in the story.

They could have forced surrender at Dunkirk if they had pressed on, but luckily Hitler's hubris prevented that from happening.

Someone mentioned German tanks and quite rightly they were running out of fuel. Apart from some tough French tanks the Germans had also been shaken by the appearance of a tiny handful of the new British Matilda Mk II tanks which were impervious to German tank and anti tank guns. German commanders were forced to use the 88 anti aircraft gun to stop the Matilda's which also lacked any cohesive infantry support. Hitler also considered a halt because he was hoping the British would be stupid enough to believe that he wanted a genuine alliance. Anyone believing that can be thankful that their grand parents weren't all hanging form trees all over the British countryside or shipped to the continent to work in concentration camps. Dunkirk was of course a defeat, but the achievement of so many little people in tiny boats (quite apart from the RN) in rescuing so many British and French troops was as outstanding an act of humanity and bravery as has ever been seen. As an aside I would recommend the earlier Dunkirk movie with John Mills among many others in it. Filmed in B & W it does not have the depth or the modern tricks this new movie will have but as a study in private trauma and simple understated fortitude while all around was collapsing it should be a must for war movie buffs.",0,FALSE,0

We're just a group of people liking this group of people and somehow we get along. Whether we watch this movie because of Harry Styles or not, let it be.

Let people watch this for whatever they want to watch it for. Let people support the people they look up to. It's funny how you all discriminate directioners as whiny little 13 year olds, but who's whining now? Don't make a small problem bigger than it already is. Harry Styles has been latched onto our directioner hearts for almost 6 years. Let us have our moment to support him, cry for him, or even scream for him in the movie. Let's respect each other. I bet all of your moms have had this type of boy band or somewhat infatuation for people who dont even know her, but still you dont even have the guts to say all these type of words infront of her.

If there's anyone it should matter to, its the rest of the cast and film people. And you know what?

If I'm being honest, the reason that I heard about this movie was because of Harry Styles and I'm a fan of him, but I've noticed a lot of immature comments about one another in this comment section. For example, non-Directioners are being insulting and attacking just because we are fans of Harry. Most of us who are fans are also very interested in actually learning about the movie's historical background as well. It's extremely disappointing to hear people telling us to ""kill ourselves"", ""get the f*** out"", or to ""get our arrogant little a**es out of here."" Everyone is saying how ""immature and stupid"" we are, but in reality, they're being just as arrogant and immature as us too. I'm not saying that it's ok for girls to watch this movie only for the reason that Harry Styles is in it, but we should definitely be given a chance to watch the trailer in peace without being attacked by many others in the comment section. I see this all as a great opportunity for young girls (and boys as well) to be educated about what happened at Dunkirk. I think we all just need to be more mature, grow up, get over ourselves, and enjoy this trailer regardless of any reason we are here.

Well, guess what - they're annoyed because this movie is about a heck of a lot more than one little teen pop star, and not only does his presence appear to be distracting from an honest discussion of the merits of the trailer's filmmaking and acting, it also seems to be over-shadowing absolutely everything else about it, including the most important aspect, which is the historical importance of the film. The fact that One Direction fans are calling other commenters ""hurt and triggered"" and saying the movie's profit will be because of him is pretty rich, and it is exactly what pisses people off, because it is arrogant and hypocritical. Your fan base is capable of some of the most 'hurt and triggered' behaviour out there - you are the ones who sob when a member leaves your favourite band, so until you guys prove that you have enough collective maturity to actually respect a film like this because you want to find out about a true historical story of bravery and loss, rather than weep over the new hair style of your crush in his few scenes, then shall you be given an iota of respect, and not before. I am a millennial too, and I do not endorse all the crap thrown at millennials - I think we work hard in a society which is against us like never before with an atrocious job and housing market, but the reason millennials get shit on is the prominence of people like the One Direction fans. I don't despise that you have your teen idols - what I and others despise is that with that can come a massive amount of vapid shallowness, a lack of intelligent knowledge of and interest in the world around you and its history. The world is about SO much more than the Kardashians and Harry Styles - it is about sacrifice, and loss, and suffering, and bravery, and hope, and you need to grow up and participate in those things. Get off of twitter and facebook, and spend some time each night reading a good novel that you'll enjoy, but one with some historical substance. Not only will your brain grow and your grades improve, but you will become a better, more well-rounded person because you will LEARN and you will THINK! Have your fun, listen to your favourite band and enjoy it, but know that the reason you are living in a free world is because of brave men like the ones in the Dunkirk trailer, know that you owe them your respect, and know that if you are ever going to get that same respect from the rest of the world that you too will have to grow up, be smart, and demonstrate to everyone that you are more than a shallow young girl obsessed with twitter. Be more, think more.  You are better than the standards which have been set for you, and you need to recognize and embrace that maturity, intelligence, and understanding to be able to ever get the respect that you seem to crave. Until then, and justly so, you will be looked upon as a shallow fan of a shallow band.",1020,TRUE,123

You most likely have an actor that you like, and if that person was starred in a movie then of course you would be somewhat interested. Harry Styles has been a singer for the some years now, and him acting is very new. We are here to support him. And who do you think we are?? Of course we take our history into consideration!! This based off a war, where people's lives were lost fighting for their Countries! Not to mention that this movie looks really good and interesting? Dunkirk is made by a director who has made really popular movies. For one, I really enjoyed interstellar.

If the UK had lost 300,000 men here they would have possibly capitulated leaving only the Russian Front for the Nazis to concentrate on.

1.4888E+12,"The British Expeditionary Forces referred to the fighting French (who bought time for the evacuation), like something out of legends of old. When they saw the French standing their ground, they compared them to the Spartans at the Battle of Thermoplyae because of their fierce resistance and honor. You see a lot of WWI equipment in this trailer because the British and French hadn't modernized their armies in the way the Nazis did. Because of that, they relied on surplus weapons and equipment left over from WWI. The British practiced Chamberlain-style isolation, while the French laid the majority of their forces on the Maginot Line in a false sense of security. This led to the Nazi's blitzing across the Ardennes forest (which the allies, particularly the French, thought impossible to cross with tanks, motorcycles, and other military vehicles along with several armies), which rendered most of France exposed on the left flank. The damage was done. And when the armies of the Third Reich encircled the armies of France and Britain, Dunkirk was the result.   The reason it's one of the most important battles in history is that it threw away the tactics used in every war up until that point. On the eve of WWI, many of the troops from participating countries were filled with glee, and thought the war would be over in less than a year. On the eve of WWII, the tone was far more serious and somber.. While many countries saw the advancement in weapon systems by the Nazis, they never expected for the war to move as fast as it did.. Poland was virtually conquered in two weeks, for example. That was unheard of, at the time. Dunkirk represents the first modernized warfare.",79,TRUE,14

Pictures Got a idea for a theatrical 2D animated film that you and Cartoon Network should do together for both of your fans out there.  Since you guys made The PowerPuff Girls Movie back in the early 2000's, you guys should make a Codename Kids Next Door prequel film, akin to The PowerPuff Girls Movie, but spectacularly more amazing and fun to behold to date and become a total box office hit of a lifetime!  Nigel Uno got accidently chosen to be a part of the Kids Next Door to be Numbuh 1 because as it turns out that he got accidently chosen for a very good reason because he's the uber-special kid out of all of the other kids around the world to stop an god-like ancient adult evil from millions and millions of years ago and his godly adult titan army from taking over the entire world in one fell swoop and also make all the kids his slaves FOREVER!!!  The 2D animation needs to be spectacularly incredible, the cast and characters needs to be the loveably exact same people that the fans knows and love so much in the show along with the new ones, the music needs to be unbelievably awesome to listen to like it was composed by the same music people who worked at Marvel Studios and so much more. It'll also not only be an unbelievably unforgettable animated masterpiece in the history of animated films itself and also be the, if not, THE #1 10 out of 10 entertainingly greatest and epic fun prequel to date in the history of prequels yet at the same time, but it'll also be absolutely on par, if not, spectacularly more epic fun than ever before than Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy itself in every way possible, period!  Respond if you like this idea.  P.S, You should also make a 2D animated remake of 1997's Batman And Robin, but a million times better (and also sexier) than the live-action original itself on SO many levels than any Batman fan could possibly ever imagine and they'll even say that this is the film they want to watch it every single day instead of the original itself for all of the right reasons.

Someone give me a genuinely good reason as to why they would use a word so strong as ""hate"" when they describe the emotion they feel when they hear the name ""Harry Styles"".  Because he's famous? Well I'll have you know Harry hates the word ""famous"" for that very reason, he feels the word gives no substance to a person. People don't say ""Harry Styles is a genuinely nice easy going dude"" which he is, they just see he's ""famous"" then instantly judge him for that.   Because he's in a ""boy band""? What? You hate him because he's a talented guy who can sing an write songs? Well that's not a very good reason and you're obviously just a very judgemental person. You do realise One Direction have released more songs than just that stupid one 'What Makes You Beautiful', that was six years ago and they have seriously grown and developed as amazing musicians since. Writing songs like 'If I Could Fly', 'Walking in the Wind', 'Fireproof', 'What a Feeling' and 'Don't Forget Where You Belong' just to name a few. Their lousy management still market them as this cheesy prepubescent boy band when they're actually so much more than that, but your judgmental self probably won't look past that to even just contemplate respecting them as serious artists.   Because his fans are annoying? Maybe so, but shouldn't you say you ""hate Harry Styles' fans"" rather than say you hate him? If you have a problem with his fans fine, take it out on us call us all the names under the sun but don't say you hate Harry just because of his fans. Also I don't know what your problem with his fans are anyway, I won't apologise for supporting one of the nicest dudes on the planet.   I dare anyone who says they ""hate"" Harry Styles to watch a few videos showing the true Harry. The ones that show he's just a normal 22 year old guy, who shakes everyone's hand when he walks into a room, who climbs like an 9 foot fence just so he could shake the hands of the crew members and thank them for their work, who goes to dominos and spends Ìâå£3000 on pizza's and spends the day handing them out to homeless people, who makes a video message for a 4 year old girl who is terminally ill, who even tho you say you ""hate"" him would probably treat you with as much respect and kindness he deserves to be shown to him, but you choose not to because he's ""Harry Styles""",0,FALSE,0

1.4888E+12,Aw poor Harry Styles haters who strongly believe he will ruin this movie when you have absolutely no idea how good he can act. I've seen 95% of Christopher Nolan movies and I know he wouldn't waste his time on someone he didn't think had potential and could make his movie better. I'm sure he appreciates him luring his fan base in for this movie but he would never risk one of his big projects just for some extra fans (he has already many of them himself ). FIY not all directors are walking Harry fanatics who scream every time they see his face or hear his voice and even so there's nothing wrong with that once in a while. I'm a proud Directioner who's not here to defend just Harry but Christopher's movie as well because even if Harry wasn't in it I was still gonna watch it because some people can actually be Nolan AND Styles fan at the same time! Fascinating isn't it? You could be a fan of two people or two things at the same time hm but I guess haters will never understand that and just assume we're here because of a talented artist who's debuting his acting career and trying something new because he has the right to.,295,TRUE,46
