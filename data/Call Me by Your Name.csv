1517923547050,"The first trailer for the indie hit ""Call Me By Your Name"" was really well put together.  It's hard to put a trailer together that really gives you the movie, without revealing everything about the movie.  The lines that they include in the trailer are pivotal to the movie, but in full context in the movie, have so much more meaning.  This is a beautiful movie.  It will touch everyone, bringing you back to so many times of your life.  From first love, to first heartbreak, to unrequited love, then full abandon.  Mistakes, triumphs, and even a throwback to the 80s that depict joyful moments in your life.  If you've ever been in love, or about to find love, with a man or a woman, this movie will speak to you.  Shot in the breathtaking backdrop of Northern Italy, the performances are spot on - Luca Guadagnino drew out such intricate performances from every actor in this movie.  Michael Stuhlbarg is the every father - you hope to have that kind of relationship, and he delivers some of the most touching and telling lines in this movie. - from describing the sculpture with undertones about relationships to the triumphant scene near the end that will have you in tears - he deserves an oscar for that performance.  Who would not fall in love with Armie Hammer's Oliver in this movie, and who hasn't fallen in love someone who couldn't commit fully to you.  Timothy Chalamet is stunning as Elio - baring all the emotions of every stage of love and heartbreak.  Was this you at one time - I think everyone might relate to him at one point or another in this movie.  Sufjan Stevens has three well placed songs in this movie, including ""Mystery of Love"", which is used in this trailer.  The songs are perfect - Guadagnino had trouble securing him for this movie, but once he did, he gave him little direction beyond giving him the book and script, and all the songs were so good that listening to them even after the movie brings you right back to those scenes and those feelings.  I think Guadagnino and James Ivory did justice to Andr√© Aciman's novel... and who knows, a sequel in a few years to finish off the book would be terrific if all these players come back.  For me, the best picture this year.  Go see this movie.  It will be worth it.",0,FALSE,0

And finally the last lingering shot of Elio's face sitting by the fire is heartbreaking. I don't think the fact that the two characters are male is relevant, as a testament to the halcyon days of first love, and the anguish of love lost, it is hard to think of a film that has captured it better.
