Jesus died so that you may live, and He is waiting on you to call upon Him in truth.
He will hear you, and He will deliver you from whatever you are experiencing. You will be saved! Hallelujah!

A few years ago, I was the biggest sinner I knew. I hated my life and wanted to die, but Jesus had other plans for me.
I have been changed. What I have experienced is very real. This is why I am preaching!

Tomorrow is not promised to us, and judgement is coming fast. Jesus is the Only Way to escape since He Himself bore our sins on the cross.

I hope you make today the day you call upon Him, if you haven't already. You will NOT regret it.
