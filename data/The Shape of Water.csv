1520292962893,"It's sad that people think this is a great movie. It's so labored and contrived. Why has the fish man been captured? Because cutting him up will somehow help us in the space race. Um, what? Why? How? Then there's Elisa's plan to break the fish man out of prison. Let's talk about this silly super secret research lab. Very important research going on there. VERY important. The fish man is a highly valuable asset. Does anyone guard the lab, inside or out? Nope. Elisa can come and go at will. The next bit of silliness is that Elisa has no idea how she's going to free the fish man from his shackles. So it's super convenient that the undercover Russian spy chooses this moment to reveal himself and free the fish man. What luck! There's a term for this kind of silliness: deus ex machina. It's what you fall back on when you're not interested in creating a believable story. There's no other reason for the Russian scientist to exist except to free the fish man. He's pure contrivance. Now for my last complaint, which is a doozy. Elisa wants to return the fish man to the ocean. So naturally the plans to release him into a canal that won't open to the ocean for a some time. Well great, because that will give her a chance to have sex with her prisoner. What? He's not her prisoner? Then why is she keeping him in her bathroom longer than necessary? Baltimore sits on the scouts a canal that won't open to the ocean until a certain date, so that's when she plans to free the fish man. But why does she have to release him into the canal? Why not just take him to the Patapsco River? It's right there!",0,FALSE,0

But I haven't watched it, so i cannot say for sure). You mustn't go, expecting a movie like the Marvel films or alike, since that will taint the experience. Go in with the mindset of watching Pan's Labyrinth. Accept what you see, and don't ask too many questions. It's gonna get weird. Real weird.

1520253380423,"Before you judge, or think, read the whole comment first, for your own good. It‚Äôs not about Love or finding something that comforts you. As people we can‚Äôt just believe everything that this movie is telling us. We must love each other and care because it is our duty to do so. Without religion, morals and ethics are made up, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we can just make random justifications if religion is not true. Regardless of religion, if a creature like this were real, we can‚Äôt go out of our way to save it because our emotions tell us to. Some who regard religion might say ‚Äúhow would you feel if you were killed and tested on‚Äù. I would say ‚Äúwell without religion my future is set, and killing it and testing it would not affect my future. And still if a creature looks, moves, has emotions like us it is still not us. If we want to test on it then we will be following the laws of the food chain. If you are regarding religion then we are just animals doing what we can to stay on top. Right, torturing it was wrong, but preventing scientific achievements is just as wrong too if you regard religion. And if we include religion then, that means the creature is not like us and we can kill it peacefully to advance as a human race. It healed the old man it gave his hair back. And that is something that god definitely permits, which is to explore medicine. We can kill plants with medicine but not a fish man. Plants are alive but just because an organism feels emotion it makes it different, now that is wrong. Hmmmm. Religion and not religion, these characters( the old man and the two main female characters) were wrong. We can‚Äôt be delusional and deceived by our own comforts. If we find a creature like this one day, no one should ever be like these main characters. We are more, we are no where near nothingness, the director of this movie is giving us a easy way out. What happened to the longer way, where we try to heal people and make them believe and know they are special and equal? We can‚Äôt just lower ourselves and love something just because it gave a feeling of love. Love has no shape because it can‚Äôt be defined or pointed out. But in fact it can. Love is also doing what‚Äôs right and making change, for each other. Not saving a fish man for yourself. Or even if you just wanted it to live, you regarded all the lives that this creature could have saved. In reality you would report that it was tortured, and make some type of movement. I‚Äôm not angry or upset, I just know that some people might be directed towards the wrong way of thinking and of solving things in life. Religion or no religion I believe Everything I have typed is true. I just may have left something out that would make you disagree with me. If you believe that a creature like this is like us and no different, and you believe in religion or not, then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. All I can say to you is that love it have sex with it, but do not interfere with the people who had it first and want to ‚Äúkill‚Äù it for scientific discovery. Because like you loving it, they are doing what they find comforting. Right? If you believe that it is like us then it really doesn‚Äôt matter if we kill it. It is only about who is doing what they want. Or if you also
think it should be free if it wants to, then we go back to the food chain, we all do what we need to survive. It escapes and let all the kind hearted people who need help die, or it dies. After all if it is like us, then basically it is either a human dies for survival ...or a human dies for survival. Same scenario. All points proven wrong. Now prove me wrong, if you can.",1,FALSE,0

1519130229870,"There are some actors and directors that can do no wrong in the eyes of The Academy and serious critics. Guillermo del Toro is definitely one of those directors. Don't get me wrong , he has made some very good films but sadly , in my opinion , The Shape of Water is definitely not one of them.
In the hidden high security government laboratory where she works, lonely Elisa is trapped in a life of isolation. Elisa‚Äôs life is changed forever when she and co-worker Zelda discover a secret classified experiment on a water based man like creature. Elisa finds she is falling in love with a creature that others want dead.

I really do not know what all the fuss was about with this film. Sure , Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon are good but they usually always are. This had the feel of an average story that you might have seen on an episode of The Twilight Zone . For a Del Toro film the special affects were very average , almost like a B movie from back in the day. Perhaps that was what he was trying to achieve ?
Why this is has been nominated for 13 Oscars is a mystery to me because this film was average at best.

1517920651631,"For those that are interested ....  WARNING: SOME SPOILERS .... read this AFTER viewing the film, if interested.

The Shape of Water is not a (traditional) story; it is a tale, a fairy tale to be more precise. GDT has said so, and it is what he says it is. I have noted that he has refrained for the past couple of months from over-playing this difference, possibly at the behest of the studio (Fox Searchlight) maybe out of the studio's fear of impact to ticket sales and Oscar awards -- a ""monster / creature"" is enough for some people to have to ""deal with"", never mind adding on ""fairy tale"". Many people (and not just film goers) are consumed with almost exclusive interest in real life stories. A story is focused on real people or people that are to be considered real. A tale is more abstract and fictional, with almost always one or more characters that humankind is not known to have encountered (e.g., The Little Red Riding Hood's talking wolf). 

GDT even beautifully frames the fairy tale for the film audience, having a voice that appears to be the Giles character narrate an opening and an ending -- the voice is telling a tale, which GDT then presents as film for 99% of the tale. The voice is the teller of the fairy tale, and the teller sees himself very much in one of the characters (Giles) of the tale -- the narrator may not actually be the Giles character, even though the voice is the same. Note: GDT also cleverly  uses the short opening narration to reinforce the expected audience's natural predilection to consider a living creature that is not human as ""a monster"", as opposed to a (deranged?) human that physically does not appear as such on initial encounter.

The ending has the same voice (tale teller) return to wrap the fairy tale and provide (some) closure to the audience with the meaning of ""the shape of water"", while leaving intended ambiguity on what transpires for Eliza -- the audience can enjoy the ending it likes/wants/considers appropriate. Ergo, GDT's modern fairy tale (? I dunno; maybe). You will note that the actual character Giles ""narrates"" (i.e., speaks to us, the audience) at one (and only one) instance in the film .... and it is right in the middle, it is rather short and wholly natural, .... and it is the absolute climax of the film, and the thesis of the fairy tale --- when Eliza demands that Giles speak back to her in vocal words (""narrates"") what she is telling him about what she has found for herself with her interactions with the river god creature -- what it is meaning to her; how it is rescuing her from her struggles as an ""other"" (someone not neatly like most people, as a mute, and with neck scars). GDT does not use subtitles here for Eliza's signing, but instead critically lays out the central thesis of the fairy tale with the protagonist (Eliza) emotionally relating it to another character that GDT has unambiguously pass on to the audience (those very many of us that do not sign), by saying back to her what she is saying, what she needs him (and GDT wants the audience) to know and understand about what she is experiencing with the river god creature. In fact , the whole repetition (signing plus voice relate back) in the delivery serves to reinforce the central thesis as message.

Beyond all that, the wide genius of the fairy tale in film form, and what makes it a relevant tale for us, is the rather timely touchstones of societal struggles of actual humankind, those that are 'other', that existed not only in the tale's human/earth/America time setting (1962), but exist (still) today (no matter what some of us might consider as 'improvements' in the 55 years since).

Once you wrap in the rest of the film's components: the excellent acting performances of the 5 central characters (I thought Michael Shannon was brilliant as the (real, human) monster), the set production, the score, the homage to films (intended to ground the fairy tale, because these historical films are not fairy tale; the shown film excerpts are known to be real), the multitude of allegories (from shoes, to color, to presences of water, to fingers (signing and lost), the beautiful filming (full of moving camera shots), the art of the costume that was the river god creature (3 years to complete), and the ultra smooth directing and editing, with the acts of the film leading comfortably one to the next, and you get the wonderful cinematic masterpiece that in all likelihood will have Academy voters preferring it, in general consensus, over all the other nominated films for Best Picture.",68,TRUE,6

It's an unoriginal movie.  It's essentially Free Willy.  Except in this movie, the boy is a mute spinster woman who masturbates in her tub every morning and helped the creature escape just so that she can have exciting trans-species sex with the creature.  The mute DIED from multiple gunshot wounds for more than a few minutes and yet miraculously grew gills when the creature healed her. 

The movie takes place in the 1960s and yet a supporting faggot character act like a 21st century post-modern faggot.  Faggots in the 1960s hid in the closet for fear of persecution.  Add to this disbelief is a bathroom in the 1960s are so incredibly waterproofed that it can be filled with water up to a metre high like a swimming pool .

The villain was so over the top and predictable and his 5-star general boss' character is cringe-worthy. The overall tone of the movie was so embarrassingly and overtly sentimental but done in a very cheesy and over the top fashion. I found all the inconsistencies to be extremely distracting too! I don't understand how Eliza, the main character, was able to sneak in the first few times and fed the merman eggs without getting caught when there were cameras in that room from day one but only in the end when she tries to rescue the merman did the cameras became important to her. When the merman escapes while her best friend/neighbor falls asleep it ends up in a movie theater all by itself watching a movie and leaving bloody hand prints all over for Eliza to find but no a single other soul saw the merman running around, the cashier at the movie must have been asleep when the merman came through the door. The good scientist, Dmitri, played by Michael Stuhlbarg, was a cheesy character and the whole Russian mafia side plot was very boring and ineffective and didn't add to the movie at all. Stuhlbarg was so brilliant in Call Me By Your Name as the father that it was disappointing to see him in his very cheesy role.

2.  The creature saves the girl from death at some point (probably from drowning)

Remember the nephilim, in times of mythology? We are seeing a repeat and don't realise it because that's 'just myth'.

There are other beings in the spiritual realm. They speak to people through inspirations and subconscious suggestions. We're working towards releasing them into our world.
What do you think all these movies, games and commercials about hybrid humans, portals, and breaking down walls are about? The all-seeing eye that people connect purely to the Illuminati, too. It represents the pineal gland, the spiritual gateway.

But there's more to it than that. The male/female signs that - decades later - now combine to make the trans symbol; the same symbol is 'coincidentally' the symbol of Orion/Saturn/Satan. If you've ever seen the Baphomet image, you will probably recall that it's part human, part goat, part male, part female.

If you want to say that these things are in the past, you should realise that the past isn't another reality. The past has journeyed into the present, and the same things exist. Things that we're now seeing reborn in the time of the scrying mirror in every home (television - think crystal ball or palantir. If you don't believe that, you only have to look at the first televisor, whose logo was the planet Saturn, AKA Orion. On the planet is a single open eye. The viewer can see places on the other side of the world, and glimpse into the past. It is a modern crystal ball, used to send spiritual images to everyone, under the guise of entertainment).

Mock me if you want. It doesn't make any difference to me, I say this as a warning for your sakes.  I know there are all kinds of strange people saying all kinds of strange things, but that's what it is.
You can easily confirm it for yourself by researching what I have said, but I'm not some nut who watched a conspiracy theory video (as credible as that is, from someone who could very well be a nutcase and not realise it) - I have studied these things for a decade, seen individual aspects for myself, and been able to piece most of it together. It's a factual part of everyday life for me, like waking up to drink coffee and seeing birds out my window - I see all of this just as plainly and undeniably. If you think about it, you will realise for yourself.

But there is also a way out of what's coming, by praying for forgiveness, turning to God and following Jesus, so that we will know to steer clear of the traps that everyone else will fall into, and not be fooled by the false Christ that will lead many to death while telling them that they're going into ascension and immortality.",0,TRUE,1

ASL isn't a thing you can learn to use realistically in the time it takes to film a movie. While the film looks great and I love Guillermo del Toro's body of work, I can't help but be disappointed by the persistent avoidance of Deaf talent. I'm not saying the movie's going to be bad, but I'm significantly less excited about it now than I was initially.

I have lost my home in fire in antioch Ca on july 7 2017...
Thankfully all of us were able to escape and no one was injured. But almost all of our belongings are gone and we dont have a place to put the rest what we were able to save that day. 
Even after trying hard we are yet not able to find a place for us to live.I have two kids of 5 and 2 years old. My husband do part time job.
Rentals are either too expensive for us to afford or not available at all. 
It is so frustrating to live as guest while our leftover stuff is decaying outside.

One of our friend set an account for us on gofundme to raise some money to help us find a place to live.... If you feel like to help us please go on the link given below and donate according to your will. Thank You God bless you.
