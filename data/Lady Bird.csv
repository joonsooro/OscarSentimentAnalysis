1517922367153,"This review from IMDB sums it up perfectly:

A trite, masturbatory piece tailored towards middle aged cat ladies and those on the path to becoming one. The drama, despite being filled with talent, lacked any semblance of depth, and could easily be likened to a comedy when you begin to view it in its proper context. It is essentially an incredibly mediocre male coming-of-age tale, but with the genders reversed.

""Lady Bird"" is the projection of what third wave feminists (for some reason) wish women were. She is the emotional pillar for those around her; she is stoic, bold, confrontational, daring, and always the first one to initiate romantic advancements. In other words, she is a caricature of masculine virtues and behavior, but as a *17 year old girl*. In the few places where she is found to be emotionally lacking, her parental counterpart (whose character is infinitely more believable by virtue of her background and hormonal makeup) steps in to fill the shoes (and/or pants). In accordance with this narrative, the men in lead roles have seemingly been injected with soy from birth. Soft-featured incompetent doughboys who lack the agency to engage life, functioning instead as submissive basket-cases, vectors through which Lady Bird asserts her outright dominance and emotional stoicism.

That's the catch. That's the novelty driving this movies popularity (besides decent acting), a young girl who acts like a man. How risqu√©, how compelling. The screenwriters and director should really give themselves a pat on the back for this one.

Anyway, there's certainly more to be said of the social agenda etched into every corner of this films script, but I've not the time nor the patience to spend another minute of my life on this trash. It is completely incongruent with reality, and therefore unrelatable to anyone who isn't living vicariously through the protagonist.

The only redeeming factor of the film was the degree to which this absurd gender reversal dynamic managed to add a veneer of comedy to virtually everything that took place (especially the ""serious"" scenes).",6,TRUE,2

1512565611108,"This trailer prompted me to see it after I saw it two days ago. 

I saw Lady Bird a few hrs. ago. It was good but not great. The acting was all good. As was the screenplay. The lead will likely get an Oscar nomination. A Golden Globe nomination for sure. 

Will likely get nominations for screenplay and direction. Deservedly so. The script is lean with no excess fat. The directing is economical and brisk.

I was really looking forward to Laurie Metcalfe. She was great on Roseanne. A scene stealer. In the movie she was like Jackie with a husband and a  teenage daughter. Somewhat disappointing in that regard. I wouldn't be surprised if she gets nominated, too.

I hate the sexist term, but it's basically a ""chick flick. Women will most appreciate it. Probably Catholics, too. I'm a former 12 year- schooled Catholic, btw. I thought that part could have been a lot stronger.

Overall I give Lady Bird a 7/10.

1504703280215,"Muhammad's life in a nutshell:
He was a poor orphan kid who eventually married a wealthy older widow, then used Christian and Jewish teachings to create his own writings with the claim that the angel Gabriel visited him and that ""allah"" was now giving him ""revelations"".  He declared himself a prophet, got himself some followers, and everyone had to do as he said.  That was the most important thing in his writings, that everyone follow his orders because he was a prophet.  At first the locals around him didn't take notice, but when Muhammad started bashing their religions they got annoyed.  He spent over a decade with only a small group of followers, and then he tried to gain more by giving recognition to the locals' gods, which made them happy.  But then he changed his mind and said Satan made him do that.  The locals mocked Muhammad and his followers, so he eventually made a declaration of war.  This pizzed the locals off even more so they decided to capture him, but he fled Mecca before they could.  Thus began Muhammad's jihad as a warlord to defeat and force the new religion of ""Islam"" onto the locals at Mecca.  He then tried making Jews happy by saying Jews can be saved by their own religion and said Jerusalem was where prayers should be directed instead of Mecca.  The Jews basically saw through his BS, so he double-downed by making the ridiculous claim that the true Jewish Torah states that he is a prophet.  And thus began Muhammad's jihad against the Jews of the area.  If any of you still think Muhammad was peaceful, remember that one of his ""revelations"" was that his army must rape the wives of their enemy....right in front of their captured husbands.  Muhammad got wealthy and fat from his conquests, had eleven wives..the last of which was 9 years old when he had sex with her, and a new ""peaceful"" religion was born.

1504703304337,"God loved each of us so much that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to bear our sin and die in our place. ‚ÄúGod demonstrates His love toward us, in that, while we were still sinners, Christ died for us‚Äù (Romans 5:8). Although we cannot understand how, God said our sins were laid upon Jesus and He died in our place. Jesus became our substitute. 

In the Bible, a jailer asked his prisoners, Paul and Silas: ‚Äú‚ÄôSirs, what must I do to be saved?‚Äô So they said, ‚ÄòBelieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved.‚Äô‚Äù (Acts 16:30-31). 

It‚Äôs very clear in the Bible, believe in Jesus as the one who bore your sins, died in your place, was buried, and whom God resurrected. It‚Äôs Christ‚Äôs blood and resurrection that assures us of everlasting life when we call on Him as our Lord and Savior. ""For whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved."" (Romans 10:13). ‚ÄúWhosoever‚Äù includes each and every one of us. but theres a eternal conmdenatin call hell, and separation from God.

Therefore, if you understand that you are a sinner, and you believe that Jesus Christ came as the one and only Redeemer of sin, then you understand the plan of salvation. The question is ‚Äì are you ready to implement the plan, by receiving God‚Äôs gift of His Son, Jesus Christ? If so, believe in Christ, repent of your sins, and commit the rest of your life to Him as Lord:

‚ÄúFather, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am truly sorry, and now I want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you. Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again. I believe that your son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my life. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.‚Äù""Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.""
